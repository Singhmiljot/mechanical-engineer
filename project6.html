            <h3>🚀 3D Printed Pedal-Operated Trash Bin – Design & Engineering Showcase</h3>
        
            <p>📌 Project Overview</p>
            <p>This 3D-printed prototype of a pedal-operated trash bin integrates mechanical design, motion study, and additive manufacturing to demonstrate an efficient and ergonomic waste management solution. The design ensures hands-free operation, optimizing both hygiene and usability.</p>
            
            <p>🛠️ Skills Demonstrated</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ Mechanical Design – Engineered for smooth pedal operation, linkage mechanisms, and structural stability.</li>
                <li>✔ 3D CAD Modeling – Designed in Fusion 360, ensuring precision, manufacturability, and optimized assembly.</li>
                <li>✔ Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) – Utilized FDM printing to prototype a functional mechanical system.</li>
                <li>✔ Material Selection – PLA for prototyping; ABS, PETG, or metal-reinforced plastic for real-world applications.</li>
                <li>✔ Motion Study & Kinematic Analysis – Simulated in Fusion 360 to validate pedal movement, force distribution, and component interaction.</li>
                <li>✔ Design for Manufacturing (DFM) & Assembly (DFA) – Simplified part integration for efficient production and user-friendly assembly.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>⚙️ Motion Analysis & Mechanism Design</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linkage System: The pedal operates via a lever-arm mechanism, smoothly lifting the lid with minimal force.</li>
                <li>Load Distribution: The foot pedal, hinges, and lid movement were analyzed to ensure long-term durability.</li>
                <li>Friction & Wear Considerations: Parts were optimized to reduce mechanical wear and improve the lifespan of the product.</li>
                <li>Tested Opening Angle: Ensures maximum lid clearance while keeping the center of gravity stable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>💡 Challenges & Learnings</p>
            <p>🔴 Challenges Faced</p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Balancing Aesthetics & Functionality – The challenge was to keep the design visually appealing while ensuring structural strength.</li>
                <li>❌ Ensuring Smooth Pedal Action – Required precise hinge alignment and lever optimization to achieve the right force balance.</li>
                <li>❌ Material Limitations in 3D Printing – PLA and ABS have different flexural strengths, so reinforcement strategies were considered.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>✅ Key Learnings</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ Iterative Prototyping – Multiple design refinements improved mechanism efficiency and part strength.</li>
                <li>✔ Material Optimization – Layer orientation and print settings significantly affect component strength and durability.</li>
                <li>✔ DFM for Mass Production – The 3D-printed version helped identify potential molded plastic or metal alternatives for large-scale manufacturing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>🌱 Engineering Ethics & Sustainable Design</p>
            <ul>
                <li>♻ Eco-Friendly Approach – Designed with biodegradable PLA & recyclable materials to reduce environmental impact.</li>
                <li>🛠️ Optimized for Manufacturing – Simplified part count and assembly process for ease of production.</li>
                <li>👥 User-Centric Design – Focused on ergonomics, accessibility, and hygiene benefits for daily use.</li>
            </ul>

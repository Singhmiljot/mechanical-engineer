            <h1>Mechanical Design Engineer Trainee</h1>
            <p>3Ding, India (Mar 2021 - Sep 2021)</p>
            <p>As a Mechanical Design Engineer Trainee at 3Ding, I worked on a project to develop new product designs using SolidWorks and AutoCAD. The goal was to meet client specifications and reduce production time by 15%. I managed the full lifecycle of design projects, from prototyping through to production, ensuring designs were ready for mass manufacturing. I also conducted analytical research and simulation testing to improve product performance and reduce defects by 10%.</p>
